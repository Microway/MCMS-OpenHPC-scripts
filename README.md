# Scripts for MCMS with OpenHPC

## This is an experimental work in progress - it is not ready for production

MCMS is Microway's Cluster Management Software. This is not the production-ready
version of MCMS. This is an ongoing project to bring Microway's expertise and
software tools to the recently-announced OpenHPC collaborative framework.

### Purpose
This collection of scripts is designed to simplify the day-to-day usage of an
HPC cluster built using the OpenHPC framework. Shortcuts are provided for common
tasks (e.g., user creation/deletion, querying nodes/partitions, etc.).

### Installation
These scripts are placed into the system paths. Scripts which are typically run
by administrators are kept separate from scripts intended from regular users
(i.e., user scripts are in `bin/` and admin scripts are in `sbin/`).
